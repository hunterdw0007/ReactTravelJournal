        description: "The vibrant Golden Gate Bridge is one of the major symbols of the state and among the most popular Northern California film locations, but the U.S. Navy originally planned to paint the bridge black with yellow stripes. The Navy thought this would make the bridge easier to see through the fog, especially while under attack. The “International Orange” color, the current hue of the bridge, was intended to be a sealant—not a color option—to protect the steel, but during transit, it caught the architect's eye and became the official color.",
